x-kong-name: bankong
# the above directive gives the entire spec file its name. This will be used for naming
# the service and upstream objects in Kong. If not given it will use the 'info.title'
# field above to name them, or a random UUID if the 'info.title' field is misssing.
# Names are converted into valid identifiers. For example,
# "Learn Services" becomes "learn-services".
# This directive can also be used on "path" and "operation" objects to name them.
# Similar to operationId, each x-kong-name must be unique within the spec file.

    # here we're using the request validator plugin, without specifying the
    # "config.body_schema" and "config.parameter_schema" properties.
    # This will tell the parser to automatically generate
    # their validation configuration based on Operation objects.
    # NOTE: this is specified on top level, causing ALL Operations to get
    # validation, since this is inherited to the Operation objects.
    # alternatively it can be specified on the Path or Operation levels as well
    # to only apply to that subset of the spec.
